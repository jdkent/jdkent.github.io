I’m the technical lead for NeuroSynth 2.0, focused on redesigning the automated meta-analysis pipeline and the supporting services that power large-scale literature synthesis.

NeuroSynth 2.0 refers to the broader ecosystem of tools we are developing. **Neurosynth Compose** is the primary entry point for researchers to sign up and interact with the platform: [compose.neurosynth.org](https://compose.neurosynth.org/).

This work includes building scalable ingestion and curation workflows, integrating modern NLP and LLM-assisted extraction, and ensuring that the system is reproducible, testable, and maintainable as a community resource.
