NiMARE (Neuroimaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment) is an open-source Python toolkit for neuroimaging meta-analysis. I maintain and develop the NiMARE ecosystem, with a focus on:

- Implementing and validating diverse meta-analytic models
- Sustainable engineering (testing, documentation builds, releases)
- Community onboarding and mentorship for new contributors

- Code: [github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE](https://github.com/neurostuff/NiMARE)
