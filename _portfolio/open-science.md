I contribute to open neuroimaging communities by teaching workshops, mentoring trainees and collaborators, and helping projects adopt standards-based workflows.

I’m especially interested in the “last mile” of open science: packaging and maintaining tools so that they remain usable for researchers who don’t have the time (or desire) to debug abandoned software.
