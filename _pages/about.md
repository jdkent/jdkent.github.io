I’m an applied informatics and open data scientist focused on turning research methods into reliable, reusable tools. My work sits at the intersection of neuroimaging, meta-analysis, and research software engineering: building platforms, libraries, and data standards that make evidence synthesis faster, more reproducible, and more accessible.

I’m currently the technical lead for **NeuroSynth 2.0**, and the lead developer of **Neurosynth Compose**—a web platform dedicated to transparent, PRISMA-aligned neuroimaging meta-analysis.

Current focus
======
- **Neurosynth Compose**: researcher-in-the-loop tooling for study curation, annotation, and meta-analytic execution — the primary entry point for the NeuroSynth 2.0 ecosystem. You can sign up and explore the platform at [compose.neurosynth.org](https://compose.neurosynth.org/).
- **NiMARE**: the neuroimaging meta-analysis Python ecosystem (maintenance, releases, onboarding, and community support).
- **Open and reproducible infrastructure**: containerized execution, CI/CD, APIs, and standards-based model specifications that help “bespoke” analysis code become community tools.

I also spend significant time mentoring and teaching—through workshops, talks, and hands-on collaboration with researchers—so that teams can adopt sustainable engineering practices alongside open science values.
