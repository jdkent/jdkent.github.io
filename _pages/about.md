I apply informatics and software engineering practices to help researchers do better, more reproducible science. I started out in neuroscience, and I picked up programming and data science skills along the way. Now, I build open-source tools and platforms that make it easier to turn research methods into reliable, open software.

I’m currently the technical lead for **NeuroSynth 2.0**, and the lead backend developer of **Neurosynth Compose**—a web platform dedicated to transparent, PRISMA-aligned neuroimaging meta-analysis.

Current focus
======
- **Neurosynth Compose**: AI-assisted tooling for study curation, annotation, and meta-analytic execution — the primary entry point for the NeuroSynth 2.0 ecosystem. You can sign up and explore the platform at [compose.neurosynth.org](https://compose.neurosynth.org/).
- **NiMARE**: the NeuroImaging Meta-Analysis Research Environment (maintenance, releases, onboarding, and community support).
- **Open and reproducible infrastructure**: containerized execution, CI/CD, APIs, and standards-based model specifications that help “bespoke” analysis code become community tools.

I also enjoy mentoring and teaching reasearchers how to build sustainable, open science software and/or how to adopt open science practices in their work.
