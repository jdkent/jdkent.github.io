My role is to translate research ideas into software and data infrastructure that other people can actually use.
Publishing analysis code on GitHub is a great start, but it can still exclude a large fraction of the community; my work is taking “bespoke” research code the rest of the way: packaging, testing, maintaining, and (when it helps) putting it behind an accessible web interface.

What I build
======
- **End-to-end platforms** for evidence synthesis (e.g., Neurosynth Compose) that support transparent, reproducible workflows.
- **Reusable libraries** (e.g., NiMARE) that implement and compare meta-analytic algorithms in a standardized API.
- **Data standards + tooling** that make it possible to share analyses as portable artifacts and to update them over time (“living” syntheses).

How I work
======
- **Reproducibility by default**: containers, pinned environments, and automation so results can be rerun and reviewed.
- **Sustainable engineering**: CI/CD, documentation, release management, and contributor onboarding so projects keep working after a paper is published.
- **Collaboration-first**: I work across researchers, engineers, and domain experts to define milestones, ship usable features, and support real users.

Mentoring and open science
======
I mentor trainees and collaborators on technical workflows (Python, Git/GitHub, testing, packaging, and data organization) and help teams adopt practices that reduce time spent debugging unmaintained tools. I’m also active in open science communities (including OHBM educational initiatives and the Open Science Room) and contribute to ecosystem standards such as BIDS.

If you’re interested in collaborating—especially on neuroimaging meta-analyses, open data infrastructure, or research-to-product translation—reach out by email.
